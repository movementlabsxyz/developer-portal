## Install Movement CLI via build from source (Linux/MacOS)

[See Details Here](https://docs.movementnetwork.xyz/devs/getstarted)

### Install

- Step 1: Clone the Aptos-core repo & go into the newly created directory

    ```rust
    git clone https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/aptos-core.git && cd aptos-core
    ```

- Step 2: Install all prerequites using automatic script
    1. Using the Automatic Script to install prerequisites

        ```bash
        ./scripts/dev_setup.sh
        ```

    2. Update your current shell environment

        ```bash
        source ~/.cargo/env
        ```

    3. Ensure you have `cargo` installed by following this commands:

        ```bash
        cargo --version
        ```

- Step 3: Build the CLI tool

    ```bash
    cargo build -p movement
    ```


> The binary will be available at `target/debug/movement`
>
- Step 4: Move this executable to a place in your path

    ```bash
    sudo cp target/debug/movement /opt/homebrew/bin/
    ```

## Build, Test & Call function on Movement

> Ensure you have the ClI installed

### Set up Development Environment

- Initialize your Aptos profile for package development and add Movement as a custom network

    ```bash
    movement init --network custom --rest-url https://aptos.testnet.porto.movementlabs.xyz/v1 --faucet-url   https://fund.testnet.porto.movementlabs.xyz
    ```


> Currently, we'll skip the faucet stage in the CLI and instead execute this through the UI via this [link](https://faucet.movementnetwork.xyz/).
>
- Sucess Result:

```bash
Configuring for profile default
Configuring for network Custom
Using command line argument for rest URL https://aptos.testnet.porto.movementlabs.xyz/v1
Not configuring a faucet because --skip-faucet was provided
Enter your private key as a hex literal (0x...) [Current: None | No input: Generate new key (or keep one if present)]

---
Movement CLI is now set up for account 0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586 as profile default!
 See the account here: https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/account/0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586?network=custom
 Run `movement --help` for more information about commands
{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```

- Here you need to pay attention to the Account that was created: `0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586`

```bash
No key given, generating key...
Account 0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586 has been initialized locally, but you must transfer coins to it to create the account onchain
```

After completing this process, a folder named `.movement` containing a `config.yaml` file will appear in your directory. All the information you previously generated will be stored in this `config.yaml` file.

### Faucet Move Token

To execute transactions on the Movement blockchain, you'll need Move Tokens to pay for transaction fees. You can obtain free Move tokens from the faucet UI using this link:

- Use the address generated in the file `.movement/config.yaml`

    ![image.png](/content-images/install-movement-cli/image.png)

- Afterwards, you can verify your token balance using the following command:

    ```bash
    movement account balance --account 0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586
    ```

    - The result below confirms that you now possess 1 Move token

    ```json
    {
      "Result": [
        {
          "asset_type": "coin",
          "coin_type": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
          "balance": 100000000
        }
      ]
    }
    ```


### Initialize your Move project

You can easily initialize a default project source code using the following command:

```bash
movement move init --name hello_movement
```

After initializing the Move source code, your folder will contain the following files and directories:

```bash
├── .movement/config.yaml
├── Move.toml
├── scripts
├── sources
└── tests
```

The key file to pay attention to is Move.toml

```js
[package] # Includes packages metadata such as name version
name = "hello_movement"
version = "1.0.0"
authors = []

[addresses]
movement = "0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586"

[dev-addresses]

# Multiline Style
[dependencies.AptosFramework]
git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git"
rev = "mainnet"
subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework"

[dev-dependencies]
```

You will copy and paste the previously generated account address into the [addresses] section to publish your contract to that address.

```js
[addresses]
movement = "0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586"
```

### Implement Code

Create your `.move` contract file in the `/sources` folder.

```toml
├── .aptos/config.yaml
├── Move.toml
├── scripts
├── sources
│   └── hello_world.move
└── tests
```

> `/sources/hello_world.move`
>

```rust
module movement::hello_world {
    use std::string::{String, utf8};
    use std::debug::print;

    struct MoveResource has key {
        string: String
    }

    public entry fun create_first_resource(caller: &signer) {
        let greeting: String = utf8(b"Hello World!!!");
        print(&greeting);
        move_to(caller, MoveResource {
            string: greeting
        });
    }

    #[test(caller = @0x1)]
    fun test_create_first_resource(caller: &signer) {
        create_first_resource(caller);
    }
}
```

- Building & Testing Contact

    ```rust
    movement move build
    ```

    Result:

    ```json
    {
      "Result": [
        "3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586::hello_world",
      ]
    }
    ```

- Testing:

    ```bash
    movement move test --filter hello_world
    ```

    Result:

    ```json
    Running Move unit tests
    [debug] "Hello World!!!"
    [ PASS ] 0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586::hello_world::test_create_first_resource
    Test result: OK. Total tests: 1; passed: 1; failed: 0
    {
      "Result": "Success"
    }
    ```


### Publish Contract & Interact on Blockchain

You can deploy your contract (modules) to the Movement blockchain using the following command:

```bash
movement move publish
```

Success Result

```bash
Transaction submitted: https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/txn/0xe019cffa060c50e067fa0522199cc5f667bab840998a30c57e70d09f6d13a77f?network=devnet
{
  "Result": {
    "transaction_hash": "0xe019cffa060c50e067fa0522199cc5f667bab840998a30c57e70d09f6d13a77f",
    "gas_used": 7260,
    "gas_unit_price": 100,
    "sender": "122d28da2607724405a4691e35f7fad06667ec32229781f8994c70f24ec59c58",
    "sequence_number": 0,
    "success": true,
    "timestamp_us": 1727944927400079,
    "version": 84201807,
    "vm_status": "Executed successfully"
  }
}
```

You can use the `transaction hash` to search for your contract on the Movement explorer:

```json
"transaction_hash": "0xe019cffa060c50e067fa0522199cc5f667bab840998a30c57e70d09f6d13a77f"
```

![image.png](/content-images/install-movement-cli/image%201.png)

Alternatively, you can search for the account you generated earlier to view the modules you have deployed.

![image.png](/content-images/install-movement-cli/image%202.png)

In each module, you can call the available functions to test or verify them directly through the user interface.

![image.png](/content-images/install-movement-cli/image%203.png)

## Call function with Movement CLI

You can easily use the CLI to call functions on the blockchain after publishing, without needing to access the explorer, by using the `movement move run` command

```json
movement move run --function-id "<module_onwer_address>::<module_name>>::<function_name>" --args <type>:<value> --sender-account <address_account>
```

In the case of the `hello_world` module, we can call it through the CLI as follows:

```json
movement move run "0x3d4dd145c51722b2b236bf544a2f12718450f4e7ab4f70c789160a5829e73586::hello_world::create_first_resource"
```
